# ElderTree Audio System — Human Voice Only

> **TL;DR:** ElderTree audio uses exclusively human voice. No TTS. No AI. No hybrid. This document defines the vocal identity, workflow, quality bar, and safeguards for a sustainable, durable audio system that compounds trust over years. Record in short sessions (20-30 min), accept natural imperfections, ship weekly or less. The goal is not polish—it's presence.

## 1. Strategic Justification

### Why Human Voice is the Permanent Choice

**Trust compounding.** Human voice is the highest-trust audio medium. Listeners detect authenticity instinctively. Over years, your voice becomes synonymous with ElderTree's identity. This cannot be replicated, cloned, or commoditized.

**Differentiation through scarcity.** As AI-generated content floods every channel, human voice becomes a luxury signal. ElderTree positions itself opposite the noise—not competing on volume, but on signal density and authenticity.

**Long-term durability.** TTS technology changes rapidly. Voice cloning raises ethical and legal questions that will evolve unpredictably. Human voice sidesteps this entirely. Your recordings from 2026 will feel as authentic in 2036.

**Identity lock-in (positive).** Your voice *is* ElderTree. This creates a moat that compounds. Listeners form parasocial trust with a specific human. This isn't replaceable by any tool—it's yours permanently.

**Philosophy alignment.** ElderTree values authenticity over scale, depth over frequency, calm authority over performance. Human voice is the only medium that embodies these values in audio form.

## 2. Non-Negotiable Principles

### What This System Prioritizes

| Priority | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Authenticity** | Real human voice, recorded in real conditions |
| **Sustainability** | Time investment compatible with full-time engineering work |
| **Durability** | Content that ages well, requires no format updates |
| **Presence** | Feeling like the author is speaking directly to you |
| **Calm** | No urgency, no performance, no hype |

### What This System Explicitly Avoids

| Avoided | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| AI TTS of any kind | Violates core identity; creates trust debt |
| Voice cloning | Ethical ambiguity; legal uncertainty; uncanny valley |
| Hybrid approaches | Half-measures create confusion and dilute brand |
| Over-production | Polish signals performance, not presence |
| Scheduled treadmill | Fixed release schedules create pressure that degrades quality |
| Growth optimization | Metrics-driven decisions poison authentic content |
| Podcast conventions | Intros, outros, ads, guest formats—all unnecessary |

### Hard Rules

1. **Every published audio file is the author's real voice**
2. **No post-processing that alters vocal character** (compression/EQ for clarity is fine; pitch correction is not)
3. **No scheduled release commitments** (publish when ready, not when due)
4. **No apologies for gaps** (the content is what it is)
5. **Natural imperfections are features, not bugs**

## 3. ElderTree Vocal Identity

### Target Vibe

> An experienced engineer thinking clearly out loud at night.

This is the north star. Every recording decision filters through this image.

### Tone

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Pace** | Unhurried. Thoughtful pauses are welcome. Speaking rate: 120-140 wpm (slower than typical podcasts at 150-180). |
| **Energy** | Quiet intensity. Not flat, not animated. Engaged but not performative. Think: explaining something you care about to a curious friend at 10 PM. |
| **Register** | Natural speaking voice, not "radio voice." Slightly lower register than casual conversation. |
| **Confidence** | Settled. Not defensive, not boastful. The confidence of someone who has done the work. |
| **Warmth** | Present but not performative. You're not selling anything. |

### Emotional Range

| Allowed | Not Allowed |
|---------|-------------|
| Genuine curiosity | Forced enthusiasm |
| Quiet satisfaction | Celebration/hype |
| Honest frustration (when earned) | Complaining/venting |
| Dry humor | Jokes for engagement |
| Reflective uncertainty | Performative humility |
| Calm authority | Lecturing |

### What ElderTree Should Never Sound Like

- A podcast trying to grow an audience
- A tutorial optimized for engagement
- Someone performing expertise
- An influencer being relatable
- A corporate voice reading scripts
- AI-generated narration
- Breathless tech news

### Vocal Signatures

- **Thinking pauses.** Let them exist. Don't edit them all out.
- **Self-correction.** "Actually, let me rephrase that..." is authentic.
- **Quiet conviction.** Statements that don't need emphasis to land.
- **Natural breath.** Audible but not distracting.

## 4. Minimal Sustainable Workflow

### Philosophy

The workflow optimizes for **starting** (low activation energy) rather than **finishing** (polish). A system that's easy to start gets used. A system that demands polish gets avoided.

### From Written Post → Published Audio

```
Written Post (exists)
       ↓
    Quick Read-Through (5 min)
       ↓
    Record Session (20-30 min max)
       ↓
    Minimal Edit (10-15 min)
       ↓
    Normalize & Export (5 min)
       ↓
    Upload with Metadata (10 min)
       ↓
    Done
```

**Total time per episode: 50-65 minutes**
(For a 15-25 minute audio piece)

### Session Structure

**Before Recording (5 min)**

1. Read the written post once, silently
2. Note 2-3 key points you want to hit naturally
3. Do NOT write a script—the written post *is* the script
4. Clear throat, drink water, settle into the chair

**Recording (20-30 min max)**

1. Start recording immediately—don't wait for "ready"
2. Read/speak naturally—this is not audiobook narration
3. Deviate from the text when natural ("As I was writing this, I realized...")
4. If you stumble badly, pause 3 seconds and restart the sentence
5. Do NOT restart the entire recording for minor issues
6. When done, say "End of recording" and stop

**Hard stop at 30 minutes.** If the content isn't done, that's a sign to split it. Never record fatigued.

### Chunking Strategy

| Post Length | Recording Approach |
|-------------|---------------------|
| < 1,500 words | Single session |
| 1,500 - 3,000 words | Single session with break midway |
| 3,000 - 5,000 words | Two sessions, two separate audio files |
| > 5,000 words | Split into parts before recording |

**Guideline:** Approximately 150 words = 1 minute of audio at ElderTree pace.

### Editing Approach

**What to edit:**

- Long silences (> 4 seconds) — trim to 2 seconds
- Obvious coughs, sneezes, external interruptions
- False starts where you restart immediately
- Clearly garbled sentences (only if unintelligible)

**What NOT to edit:**

- Natural pauses (1-3 seconds)
- Verbal fillers ("um," "uh") — if sparse, keep them
- Slight stumbles that self-correct
- Breath sounds
- Ambient room tone
- Perfect delivery—don't keep redoing for "better takes"

**Target edit time: 10-15 minutes for a 20-minute recording.**

If editing takes longer, you're over-editing.

### Publishing Cadence

| Cadence | Recommended |
|---------|-------------|
| **Maximum** | One per week |
| **Sustainable** | One every 2-3 weeks |
| **Acceptable** | Monthly |
| **Floor** | Quarterly (minimum to maintain presence) |

**No commitments.** Publish when ready. Gaps are fine. Consistency matters over years, not weeks.

### Session Scheduling

**Best times to record:**

- Evening (8-10 PM) — matches the "thinking at night" vibe
- Early morning before work starts
- Never right after meetings or stressful events

**Minimum conditions:**

- Quiet environment (no HVAC if possible)
- Not rushed
- Not tired
- Not sick
- Water nearby

## 5. Quality Bar

### What "Good Enough" Sounds Like

- Clear enough to understand every word
- Natural pacing with real pauses
- Consistent volume (no major peaks/drops)
- Background noise minimal but not zero
- Your actual voice, not a performance

### Concrete Thresholds

| Aspect | Acceptable | Unacceptable |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| Audio clarity | Can understand 95%+ on first listen | Words frequently unclear |
| Background noise | Faint, consistent room tone | Distracting sounds, traffic, interruptions |
| Vocal energy | Engaged, present | Monotone or exhausted |
| Stumbles | Occasional, self-corrected | Multiple per minute, confusing |
| Recording quality | -12 to -6 dB peaks | Clipping, distortion |

### Perfectionism Traps to Avoid

**Don't re-record because:**

- You said "um" twice
- A sentence could have been clearer
- You hear a slight throat noise
- The cadence felt slightly off
- You thought of a better way to phrase something

**Do re-record if:**

- Audio is technically broken (clipping, buzz, echo)
- You said something factually wrong
- An entire section is unintelligible
- External interruption ruined a significant portion

### The 80% Rule

If a recording is 80% good, ship it. The remaining 20% of polish has diminishing returns and costs disproportionate time.

## 6. Failure Modes & Safeguards

### Failure Mode 1: Recording Avoidance

**Symptom:** Weeks pass without recording. Always "not the right time."

**Root cause:** Activation energy too high. Perfectionism masking as standards.

**Safeguard:**
- Keep equipment always set up
- Define "minimum viable session" (10 minutes counts)
- Record even when not sure—trash later if needed
- Schedule a recurring calendar block, but attendance is optional

### Failure Mode 2: Over-Editing

**Symptom:** A 20-minute recording takes 2+ hours to edit.

**Root cause:** Treating audio like written prose. Trying to manufacture polish.

**Safeguard:**
- Set a timer: 15 minutes max edit time
- If it needs more, the recording itself was the problem—don't salvage it
- Establish a "no more than 3 edits per minute of audio" rule

### Failure Mode 3: Treadmill Pressure

**Symptom:** Feeling behind, guilty about gaps, rushing recordings.

**Root cause:** Internalized podcast/creator norms. Measuring against others.

**Safeguard:**
- No public schedule. Ever.
- Never apologize for gaps in recordings
- Remind: ElderTree optimizes for decades, not weeks
- If you feel pressure, skip a month intentionally

### Failure Mode 4: Quality Creep

**Symptom:** Adding intros, outros, music, better mics, acoustic treatment, new software.

**Root cause:** Confusing production value with content value.

**Safeguard:**
- Freeze equipment decisions for 1 year minimum
- No intros/outros. Content starts immediately.
- If something "needs" upgrading, wait 3 months. Still need it? Consider it.

### Failure Mode 5: Scope Creep

**Symptom:** Thinking about video, guests, live streams, other formats.

**Root cause:** Distraction from core mission. Chasing medium instead of message.

**Safeguard:**
- Hard rule: audio only for 2 years minimum
- No guests. Solo only. (Guests require coordination, editing, scheduling—all friction.)
- Video is explicitly out of scope

### Failure Mode 6: Health Interference

**Symptom:** Can't record due to voice fatigue, illness, or burnout.

**Root cause:** Reality. Human voices need rest.

**Safeguard:**
- Buffer: always have 1-2 finished recordings unreleased
- If sick, don't record. Period.
- If burned out, written posts continue—audio pauses. That's fine.

## 7. Equipment & Technical Setup

### Recommended Setup (Minimal)

| Component | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Microphone** | USB condenser (Audio-Technica AT2020 USB, Blue Yeti) |
| **Position** | 6-8 inches from mouth, slightly off-axis |
| **Environment** | Quiet room, soft surfaces preferred |
| **Software** | Audacity (free), or any simple DAW |
| **Format** | Export as MP3, 128kbps (spoken word) |

### What You Don't Need

- XLR setup with audio interface
- Acoustic treatment
- Pop filter (just angle the mic)
- Sound booth
- Professional editing software
- Mixing/mastering

### Recording Checklist

```
[ ] Environment quiet
[ ] Mic positioned correctly
[ ] Recording software open
[ ] Levels checked (-12 to -6 dB speaking normally)
[ ] Water nearby
[ ] Phone silenced
[ ] Written post open for reference
```

### File Naming Convention

```
eldertree-audio-YYYY-MM-DD-title-slug.mp3
```

Example: `eldertree-audio-2026-02-15-understanding-etcd.mp3`

## 8. Final Recommendation

**Build the simplest possible system and protect it fiercely.**

Your voice is ElderTree's most valuable asset. It cannot be replicated, automated, or scaled—and that's precisely the point. In a world flooded with synthetic content, human voice becomes rare, and rarity compounds into trust.

The system outlined here is deliberately minimal. Resist the urge to add. The goal is not to produce a podcast—it's to extend your written thoughts into audio form with the least friction possible.

Record when you have something worth saying. Ship when it's good enough. Let gaps exist without apology. This is a decades-long project. A missed month means nothing. A burned-out author means everything.

**The one rule that matters:** Your real voice. Your real thoughts. Your real pace. Everything else is negotiable.
