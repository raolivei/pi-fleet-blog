# Recording Notes — Human Voice Approach

> **Policy:** All ElderTree audio is recorded with the author's real human voice. No AI TTS. No voice cloning. See [`docs/AUDIO_SYSTEM.md`](../docs/AUDIO_SYSTEM.md) for the complete system.

## About the Episode Scripts

The `script.md` files in each episode folder are **reference material**, not scripts to read verbatim. They contain:

- The narrative arc and key points
- Technical details to cover
- Lessons learned to mention

**When recording, you should:**

- Use the script as a guide, not a teleprompter
- Speak naturally, as if explaining to a curious friend
- Deviate when it feels natural
- Skip sections that don't flow
- Add thoughts that come up in the moment

## What to Ignore in Scripts

The scripts were originally generated with podcast/TTS conventions. **Ignore these when recording:**

| Script Element | What to Do Instead |
|----------------|---------------------|
| `[Opening music fades in]` | Start talking immediately |
| `[Music swells]` | Just continue naturally |
| `[Outro music]` | End when done—no formal closing |
| "Welcome back to Building Eldertree" | Skip—or say it once in episode 1 only |
| "I'm your host" | Skip—your voice is the identity |
| "Subscribe and share" | Never say this |
| "Trust me, you won't want to miss it" | Skip hype language |
| "[pause - 2 seconds]" | Pause naturally when it feels right |

## Recording Structure

Instead of the scripted structure, use this:

**Opening (15-30 seconds)**
- Brief context: "This is about [topic]"
- Optional: "This is part of the Eldertree series" (first episode only)

**Main Content**
- Follow the narrative arc from the script
- Cover the key technical points
- Share the real experience—what actually happened

**Closing (15-30 seconds)**
- Brief summary of what was covered
- Optional: hint at what comes next
- End naturally—no call to action

## The Vibe

> An experienced engineer thinking clearly out loud at night.

- Unhurried, thoughtful
- Quiet intensity, not animated
- Natural pauses are good
- Self-correction is authentic
- Slight stumbles are human

## Checklist Before Recording

```
[ ] Read the script once (reference, not memorization)
[ ] Note 2-3 key points you want to hit
[ ] Quiet environment
[ ] Water nearby
[ ] Mic positioned
[ ] Start when ready—don't overthink
```
