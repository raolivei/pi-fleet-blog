# Building Eldertree - Cover Art Design

## Final Design (AI-Generated)

The selected cover art features:

### Visual Elements
- **Circuit board tree** - Green glowing PCB traces forming a tree shape
- **Raspberry Pi stack** - 3 stacked Pi boards representing the 3-node cluster
- **Kubernetes logo** - Blue hexagonal helm wheel (bottom left)
- **Podcast icon** - Spotify/podcast microphone icon (bottom right)
- **Green glow effect** - Ambient lighting emanating from the tree base

### Typography
- **Title:** "Building Eldertree" (white, bold, sans-serif)
- **Subtitle:** "A Raspberry Pi Kubernetes Journey" (gray, lighter weight)

### Color Palette
- Background: Dark charcoal/black gradient
- Accent: Bright green (#00ff00 variants) for circuit traces
- Kubernetes: Blue (#326ce5)
- Text: White and gray

### Symbolism
- The **circuit tree** represents organic growth from technology
- The **3 stacked Pis** = the 3-node HA cluster
- **Green LEDs** on the Pis suggest they're running/healthy
- The **Kubernetes wheel** connects to the "building" theme

## Suggested Enhancements

   - Episode 7 (HA): Gold glow
   - Episode 8 (Troubleshooting): Red/orange glow
